# simple-blog

### In this project, we designed a simple blog using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask and Python. This blog has the following features:
- Registration
* entry and exit
+ Display posts 
- Adding a new post
* Display the number of registered users

### In the following, we will explain each of these facilities: 
#### Part 1: Registration
In this section, the user enters his username, e-mail address and password, and if the registration is successful, he will be redirected to the login page, and if the registration is unsuccessful, he will stay on the same page.
